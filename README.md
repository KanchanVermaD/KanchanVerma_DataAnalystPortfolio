## [Project 1: CUSTOMER CHURN MODELLING USING ANNs] (https://github.com/KanchanVermaD/KanchanVerma_DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/Customer-Churn-Predictions)
Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
Training model in ANNs(Artificial Neural Network) using keras.
Developed a model for customer churn prediction that is if customer will exit or stay.




## [Project 2: MNIST CLASSIFICATION USING ANN](https://github.com/KanchanVermaD/KanchanVerma_DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/MNIST)
MNIST data set is available with keras dataset and has 70000 rows and is predivided in training and test data.
Steps:
1. Uploaded data file from keras dataset.
2. Used feature scaling to reduce data size.
3. Trained model using ANN algorithm.
4. In phase 1 trained model with one layer.
5. In phase 2 trained model with two layers.
6. Compared the results using confusion matrix and visualizations using seaborn heatmap.
