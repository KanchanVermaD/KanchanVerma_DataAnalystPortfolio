# [Project 1: MNIST CLASSIFICATION USING ANN](https://github.com/KanchanVermaD/KanchanVerma_DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/MNIST)
MNIST data set is available with keras dataset and has 70000 rows and is predivided in training and test data.
Steps:
1. Uploaded data file from keras dataset.
2. Used feature scaling to reduce data size.
3. Trained model using ANN algorithm.
4. In phase 1 trained model with one layer.
5. In phase 2 trained model with two layers.
6. Compared the results using confusion matrix and visualizations using seaborn heatmap.

# [Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN](https://github.com/KanchanVermaD/KanchanVerma_DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/Customer-Churn-Predictions)

Customer Churn prediction is done in many customer oriented businesses. These may be bank or restaurants or a shop selling goods. The data is collected for the customers with information ranging from their age, gender,geography etc to the purchases or transactions done.
When the data is collected, it may have some null values or it may scale from low to high ranges.
So first step in any model building is understanding data and doing some preprocessing.
Steps:
Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
Training model in ANNs(Artificial Neural Network) using keras.
Developed a model for customer churn prediction means a customer will exit or stay.
